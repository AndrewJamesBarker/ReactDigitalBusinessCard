        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I’m a creative and passionate professional with experience in web development, graphic design/wireframing, pipe organ technician, and music performance. I have a strong work ethic and a talent for creative analytic problem-solving. These skills, paired with my previous work as a teacher and a technician, help me develop intuitive, user-friendly interfaces. I’m a lifelong learner.</p>
         <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>In my spare time I enjoy playing chess, making and listening to music, reading, and spending time with my friends and family. I enjoy both the front and back end of Web Development, and Javascript is probably my favorite langauge to date.</p>
